First, 
`
git clone --recursive git@github.com:libpd/libpd.git
cd libpd
make EXTRA=true
make install
`

On Windows, copy the lib from /usr/local/lib to /usr/local/bin
where my other dlls are
`
cp /usr/local/lib/libpd.dll /usr/local/bin
`

Mac includes OpenAL so things should then just work out of the box.

On Windows, you'll need OpenAL-soft http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html#installing

Copy bin/Win64/soft-oal.dll to c:\msys64\usr\local\bin\OpenAL32.dll
